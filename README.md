# A-model-for-the-continuous-emergence-and-fading-of-vegetation-clusters-in-semiarid-landscapes
Simulation code for an individual-based model exploring how the stochastic action of the local Allee effect drives the emergence and disappearance of vegetation clusters in semiarid landscapes. Includes core routines and example notebooks to reproduce the main results of the paper.
